# Using shepherd with cloudgate

Cloudgate is used internally inside of VMware to provision AWS and Azure accounts.
Currently AWS is used for the astrolabe demos.
To use shepherd you will need a Cloudgate account and then you will need to configure
a shepherd account group and account.  Use the setup-cloudgate-shepherd.sh script
to set these up.  You will need the following info:

* account_group name - The name of the account group to create
* Cloudgate API Client ID - get this by creating a cloudgate API client (goto "My Account" and select API Clients tab)
* Cloudgate API Client Secret - get this by creating a Cloudgate API client
* Organizational Unit ID - From the Cloudgate portal, pick the organization you want 
to use and the organizational ID will be in the Account Type line 
(Account Type: Organization Unit (---OU ID---)
* Account ID - The Account ID for the account you want to use
* Master Account ID - The account ID for the organization you want to use
